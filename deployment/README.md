## 🎯 Choose Your Deployment Route

We support **two deployment methods**. Choose the one that fits your needs:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  WHICH ROUTE SHOULD YOU USE?                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

   How many devices?
   ├─ 1-5 devices       →  Route 1: Fresh Installation
   └─ 10+ devices       →  Route 2: Golden Image Cloning

   Do you have on-site internet?

## 📦 What's Included in Both Routes

Both deployment methods install:

- ✅ **OK Monitor device software** (camera capture and cloud sync)
- ✅ **Auto-start on boot** (systemd service)
- ✅ **Hybrid automatic updates** (dual-layer approach)
  - Pre-start updates: Every boot/restart automatically pulls latest code
  - Scheduled updates: Daily at 2:00 AM for long-running devices
  - Fail-safe: Service won't start if update fails (never runs outdated code)
- ✅ **Comitup WiFi hotspot** (web-based WiFi setup, no SSH needed)
- ✅ **addwifi.sh script** (backup WiFi configuration tool via SSH)
- ✅ **Tailscale remote access** (pre-installed, connect with auth key)
- ✅ **Camera support** (USB webcam)
- ✅ **Configuration management** (environment variables)
- ✅ **Debug frames disabled** (saves disk space, enable if needed)

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

### Hardware

- **Raspberry Pi 5** (4GB or 8GB RAM recommended)
- **MicroSD card** (32GB minimum, 64GB recommended)
- **USB webcam** (compatible with V4L2)
- **Power supply** (official Raspberry Pi 5 27W USB-C)
- **Internet connection** (Ethernet or WiFi)

### Software

- **Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm** (64-bit, Desktop or Lite)
- **SSH enabled** (via raspi-config or Imager settings)
- **VNC enabled** (optional, for remote desktop)

### Information Needed

Before starting, gather this information:

- ✅ **Cloud API URL** (your Railway/cloud deployment)
  - Example: `https://okmonitor-production.up.railway.app`
- ✅ **Device ID(s)** (unique identifier for each device)
  - Examples: `okmonitor1`, `floor-01-cam`, `warehouse-entrance`
- ✅ **WiFi credentials** (if using wireless)
  - SSID and password for each deployment site
- ✅ **Tailscale auth key** (optional, for remote access)
  - Generate at: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying via either route, verify everything works:

```bash
# Run automated verification
sudo deployment/verify_deployment.sh
```

This checks:
- ✅ Service is running
- ✅ Camera is accessible
- ✅ Cloud API is reachable
- ✅ Configuration is valid
- ✅ Updates are scheduled
- ✅ All permissions are correct

📖 **See:** [verify_deployment.sh](verify_deployment.sh)

## 🌐 Additional Features

### 📱 WiFi Configuration

**Method 1: Comitup (Recommended for field deployment)** - No SSH needed!

Zero-touch WiFi setup:
1. Connect phone to **okmonitor-XXXX** WiFi (no password)
2. Open browser to **http://10.41.0.1**
3. Select customer WiFi and enter password
4. Device connects automatically!

📖 **Full guide:** [COMITUP.md](COMITUP.md)

**Method 2: addwifi.sh (Backup - requires SSH)**

Easy WiFi setup via command line:

```bash
~/addwifi.sh "Network-Name" "password" [priority]
```

📖 **Full guide:** [WIFI.md](WIFI.md)

### Remote Access (Tailscale)

Secure SSH and VNC access from anywhere:

```bash
sudo deployment/install_tailscale.sh --auth-key YOUR_KEY
```

📖 **Full guide:** [TAILSCALE.md](TAILSCALE.md)

### 🔄 Uninstall and Reinstall

Need to completely remove OK Monitor or perform a clean reinstall?

**Uninstall everything (preserves Tailscale for remote access):**

```bash
sudo deployment/uninstall.sh --keep-packages
```

**Safe remote reinstall (won't disconnect Tailscale):**

```bash
sudo deployment/install_device.sh --skip-tailscale
```

The uninstall script removes all OK Monitor components while intelligently preserving Tailscale, so you never lose remote access to your devices. Perfect for troubleshooting, upgrades, or clean reinstalls.

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### Service won't start

```bash
sudo journalctl -u okmonitor-device -n 50
sudo systemctl status okmonitor-device
```

Common causes:
- Camera not connected → Check USB connection
- Wrong DEVICE_ID → Must not be "PLACEHOLDER_DEVICE_ID"
- API unreachable → Check network and API_URL

### Camera not found

```bash
v4l2-ctl --list-devices
ls -l /dev/video*
```

Solution: Update CAMERA_SOURCE in `/opt/okmonitor/.env.device`

### Network issues

```bash
curl -I https://okmonitor-production.up.railway.app/health
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
```

Solution: Configure WiFi with `~/addwifi.sh` or connect Ethernet

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Route 1: Fresh Install
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/atxapple/okmonitor.git
cd okmonitor

# IMPORTANT: Configure .env.device FIRST
sudo mkdir -p /opt/okmonitor
sudo nano /opt/okmonitor/.env.device
# Set: API_URL, DEVICE_ID, CAMERA_SOURCE

# Then run installer with Tailscale (recommended)
sudo deployment/install_device.sh --tailscale-key tskey-auth-xxxxx
# Or without: sudo deployment/install_device.sh

sudo deployment/verify_deployment.sh  # Verify
```

### Reinstall (Remote - Preserves Tailscale)
```bash
# Uninstall (keeps Tailscale running)
sudo deployment/uninstall.sh --keep-packages

# Reinstall without touching Tailscale
sudo deployment/install_device.sh --skip-tailscale

sudo deployment/verify_deployment.sh  # Verify
```

### Route 2: Clone and Customize
```bash
# On each cloned device:
ssh mok@okmonitor.local
sudo deployment/customize_clone.sh  # Set device ID

# Configure WiFi - Method 1 (Comitup - no SSH needed):
# 1. Connect to okmonitor-XXXX WiFi
# 2. Browse to http://10.41.0.1
# 3. Configure customer WiFi

# Or Method 2 (addwifi.sh via SSH):
~/addwifi.sh "WiFi-Name" "password"

sudo deployment/verify_deployment.sh  # Verify
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### Naming Convention

Use descriptive, consistent device IDs:

**Good:**
- `floor-01-cam` - Clear location
- `warehouse-entrance` - Clear purpose
- `site-alpha-cam-01` - Site + sequence

**Bad:**
- `cam1` - Too generic
- `test` - Not descriptive
- `raspberry-pi` - Doesn't indicate purpose

### Security

1. **Change default password:**
   ```bash
   passwd
   ```

2. **Enable Tailscale** for secure remote access instead of opening ports

3. **Don't commit credentials** to git repository

4. **Use strong WiFi passwords** (12+ characters)

### Maintenance

**Automatic Updates** (Hybrid Strategy):
- Pre-start updates: Every boot/restart automatically updates to latest code
- Scheduled updates: Daily at 2:00 AM for long-running devices
- See [DEPLOYMENT.md - Update Policy](DEPLOYMENT.md#update-policy) for details

**Monitoring**:
- Monitor service logs: `sudo journalctl -u okmonitor-device -f`
- Check update logs: `sudo cat /var/log/okmonitor-update.log`
- For fleet management: Use Tailscale + SSH for bulk operations
